### Day 1: Big O & Arrays

Your journey starts with the absolute fundamentals: understanding how to measure an algorithm's efficiency (Big O Notation) and mastering the most common data structure, the array.

- **Watch:** [Big O Notation In 100 Seconds](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWH5NYb7zI4g) by Fireship, followed by a more in-depth video like [Data Structures: Arrays](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJgwnjM3aJjM) by HackerRank. (35 mins)
- **Do:** **Project Task:** Solve the classic ["Two Sum" problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/). Frame it as building a utility function that finds matching pairs in a user dataset. This is a fantastic first step in applying array manipulation and thinking about efficiency. (70 mins)
- **Reflect:** In your notes, explain the difference between $O(1)$, $O(n)$, and $O(n^2)$ time complexities using the code you just wrote (or pseudo-code) as an example. (15 mins)

üí° _Motivation:_ You've just laid the cornerstone for your entire DSA journey. Understanding efficiency is your new superpower. Well done on taking this crucial first step\!

### Day 2: Linked Lists

Today, we'll move from static arrays to dynamic nodes. Linked Lists are essential for understanding memory and pointers.

- **Watch:** [Data Structures: Linked Lists](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnjTh_16cIuU) by freeCodeCamp.org to get a clear visual and conceptual overview. (30 mins)
- **Do:** **Mini-Project:** Create a simple command-line playlist manager. Using a Singly Linked List, implement three functions: `add_song(song_name)`, `remove_song(song_name)`, and `print_playlist()`. This project mimics how many music apps manage their queues. (80 mins)
- **Reflect:** Grab a pen and paper and draw a diagram of your playlist with at least three songs. Now, sketch out the steps required to add a new song to the middle of the list. (10 mins)

üí° _Motivation:_ Every new node you link is a symbol of your growing knowledge. You're learning to connect ideas and build more complex structures. Keep going\!

---

### Day 3: Stacks & Queues

Let's explore two powerful linear data structures that are all about order: Stacks (Last-In, First-Out) and Queues (First-In, First-Out).

- **Read:** This GeeksforGeeks article on ["Stack Data Structure"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure-introduction-program/) and ["Queue Data Structure"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/) to understand the core operations. (30 mins)
- **Do:** **Project Task:** Implement a function that checks for balanced parentheses in a code snippet (e.g., `"{[()]()}"`). Use a Stack to track the opening brackets. This is a classic interview problem that simulates how code editors and compilers work. (75 mins)
- **Reflect:** Think of and write down one real-world analogy for a Stack (e.g., a stack of plates) and one for a Queue (e.g., a line at a checkout counter). (15 mins)

üí° _Motivation:_ You're learning to bring order to chaos. The principles you practiced today are key to managing processes and solving problems elegantly. Amazing progress\!

### Day 4: Hash Tables

Time to unlock incredible speed\! Hash Tables (or Hash Maps/Dictionaries in many languages) are a favorite in interviews for their lightning-fast data retrieval.

- **Watch:** [Hash Tables Explained](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dshs0I0HMy_Q) by Programiz to understand how key-value pairs, hashing, and collision handling work. (35 mins)
- **Do:** **Project Task:** Build a simple contact book using your language's built-in Hash Map. Your program should be able to add a name (key) with a phone number (value), look up a number by name, and delete an entry. (70 mins)
- **Reflect:** In your own words, briefly explain what a "hash collision" is and why it's important to handle. (15 mins)

üí° _Motivation:_ Hash Tables are a game-changer for performance. By mastering them, you've added a serious tool to your problem-solving arsenal. You're thinking like an engineer\!

---

### Day 5: Trees (Binary Search Trees)

Let's branch out\! Today, you'll learn about Trees, a non-linear data structure perfect for representing hierarchical information. We'll focus on the Binary Search Tree (BST).

- **Watch:** [Binary Search Tree (BST) Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYT9F8_LFTM) by mycodeschool. His explanations are incredibly clear and intuitive. (40 mins)
- **Do:** **Project Task:** Code a simple `Node` class for a BST. Then, implement an `insert` function. Create a tree and insert the following values: `10, 5, 20, 8, 3`. Draw the final tree on paper to verify that your insertion logic is correct. (70 mins)
- **Reflect:** Write down the core rule of a BST that makes it so efficient for searching. What is the average time complexity for a search, insert, or delete operation? (10 mins)

üí° _Motivation:_ You're officially thinking in multiple dimensions now\! Trees are the backbone of databases, file systems, and more. This is a huge leap forward.

---

### Day 6: Recursion

Recursion is a powerful but sometimes tricky concept where a function calls itself. It's a fundamental pattern in computer science, especially for tree traversal and sorting.

- **Watch:** [Recursion for Beginners](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DL1i2-qfk2wU) by freeCodeCamp.org to build a solid mental model. (40 mins)
- **Do:** **Practice Task:** Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`). Pay close attention to defining your "base case" to stop the recursion. (65 mins)
- **Reflect:** What is a "base case" and what happens if you forget to include one in a recursive function? (15 mins)

üí° _Motivation:_ Recursion can feel like bending your mind, and you did it\! This is one of the most significant conceptual hurdles, and you're tackling it head-on. Be proud of this\!

### Day 7: Review & Mock Challenge

It's time to put it all together\! Today is about consolidating your knowledge from the week and applying it to a problem that requires you to choose the right tool for the job.

- **Do:** **Mock Interview Challenge:** Head to a platform like LeetCode or HackerRank and solve a new problem. Read the problem carefully and ask yourself: "Which data structure I learned this week would be best for this?" Try the ["Valid Anagram"](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) problem‚Äîit‚Äôs a great test of Hash Map knowledge. (90 mins)
- **Reflect:** Look back at your notes and code from the past six days. Write down the top 3 most important concepts you learned. Which data structure are you most excited about? Which one needs a bit more practice? (30 mins)

üí° _Motivation:_ You made it\! A full week of focused, dedicated learning. This is a massive accomplishment. You've built a solid foundation and, more importantly, a consistent habit. This is just the beginning of your success story. Keep that momentum\! ‚ú®
